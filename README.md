# Diabetes-Detection using Machine Learning
<hr>
# Overview 
Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also a creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness, kidney diseases, etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. Moreover, every time they want to get their diagnosis report, they have to waste their money in vain.
But with the rise of Machine Learning approaches we have the ability to find a solution to this issue, we have developed a system  which has the ability to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not. Furthermore, predicting the disease early leads to treating the patients before it becomes critical. Data mining has the ability to extract hidden knowledge from a huge amount of diabetes-related data. Because of that, it has a significant role in diabetes research, now more than ever. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can predict the diabetic risk level of a patient with a higher accuracy.
